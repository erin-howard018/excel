This is a simple Excel project that takes a dataset on Coffee Orders through stages of cleaning and then producees a basic 
interactive dashboard that allows us to learn more about our customers.

I completed this projecy by following the youtube video 'The ONLY EXCEL PORTFOLIO PROJECT YOU NEED' 
from MoChen which can be found at this link (www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM&t=12s&ab_channel=MoChen). 

**Downloads**

The raw dataset can be downloaded from the file named coffeeOrdersData.xlsx in this Coffee Orders Dashboard folder. 

My working and interactive dashboard can be found in the file named coffeeOrdersDashboard.xlsx in this Coffee Orders Dashboard folder.
