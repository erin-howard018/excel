This is a simple Excel project that takes a dataset on Bike Sales through stages of cleaning and then producees a basic 
interactive dashboard that allows us to learn more about our customers.

I completed this projecy by following the youtube video 'Full Project in Excel | Excel Tutorials for Beginners' 
from AlexTheAnalyst which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJgMj1IUrc).
